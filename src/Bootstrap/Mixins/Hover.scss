// Hover mixin and `$enable-hover-media-query` are deprecated.
//
// Originally added during our alphas and maintained during betas, this mixin was
// designed to prevent `:hover` stickiness on iOS-an issue where hover styles
// would persist after initial touch.
//
// For backward compatibility, we've kept these mixins and updated them to
// always return their regular pseudo-classes instead of a shimmed media query.
//
// Issue: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/25195
